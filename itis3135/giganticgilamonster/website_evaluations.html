            <p>This website has a good design because it has contrast, good repetition, is easy to understand and intuitive to interact with.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www2.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-ray Inc</a></h3>
            <p>This website is not a good example of CRAP principles as there is a large amount of confusion going on. Little to no contrast as the entire screen is a strange blue that hurts the eyes. Additionally, the organization on the page is poor which makes it hard to interact with.</p>
