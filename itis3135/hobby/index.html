            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <div>
                    <p>Pole vaulting is a jumping event in the sport of track and field. The purpose of the event is to see how high you can propel yourself into the air with a long and flexible fiberglass pole.</p>

                    <h3>Key Requirements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speed: Crucial for generating the necessary momentum to put energy into the pole that will then transfer the energy back to you.</li>
                        <li>Strength: Needed to control the pole and propel the body upwards.</li>
                        <li>Agility: Helps in executing the precise gymnastic aspects of the vault. It is also useful when having to bail from a sketchy jump.</li>

                        <p>The world record for men's pole vault is held by Armand Duplantis, with a height of 6.27 meters / ~20.5 feet.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>My dad pole vaulted at Appalachian State University and was my inspiration to begin my own vaulting journey. We spent countless days together practicing at my highschool that I will never forget. With his help, I was able to achieve three state titles, a school record, and a spot on the all-time performances list for North Carolina Highschoolers. At one point, he started vaulting again at age 50.</p>

                        <li>High School: Many high schools offer pole vaulting, though it varies by state as in some, pole vaulting is not allowed.</li>
                        <li>College: Collegiate athletes often compete in pole vaulting events at regional and national levels.</li>
                        <li>Professional: Professional pole vaulters compete in international competitions, including the Olympics.</li>

            <h2>When Does Pole Vault Take Place?</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <div>
                    <p>Typically pole vaulting can be practiced or even competed almost year round. However it depends on training programs as well as environmental conditions. When it gets too cold or if it is raining, we will have to reschedule practices due to safety hazards. That is why it is so beneficial to have an indoor facility, unfortunately Charlotte does not.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spring: The most popular season for track and field, this is when you will be able to spectate the most pole vault.</li>
                        <li>Summer: Outside of clubs, a summer season is not nearly as popular as spring. I used to participate in summer track when I was on my recruitment journey.</li>
                        <li>Fall/Winter: There is a dead period during some of the fall that consists of a pre-season. However, early December is usually when our indoor season will start. This season is usually harder because of the temperature during our practices.</li>

                    <p>A cool feature of the pole vault is that it can be practiced anywhere with a mat. I was fortunate enough to have a pole vault facility in highschool and of course now in college. Though as I improved, my dad and I would travel 1.5 hours to a club and vault there.</p>

            <h2>How Does Pole Vaulting Work?</h2>
            <div class="content-wrapper">
                <div>
                    <p>One of the coolest things about pole vault is that there are so many different ways to do it. The first thing that must be done is to find the right pole for yourself. Then understanding the running mechanics while holding the pole comes next. After that, it is important to learn to properly plant the pole and be comfortable with it bending. Then comes the invert where you will turn upside down and shoot off the top.</p>

                    <h3>Step-by-Step:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Approach: The athlete runs towards the bar with the pole to gain momentum but remain relaxed and controlled.</li>
                        <li>Plant and Takeoff: The pole is planted into the box, and the athlete takes off from the ground.</li>
                        <li>Inversion: The athlete swings their legs up and turns upside down in the air.</li>
                        <li>Extension: The athlete extends their body out of the inversion and pulls themselves up the pole as it throws them.</li>
                        <li>Clearance: The athlete (hopefully) clears the bar and makes a safe landing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="fun-fact">
                        <h4>Fun Fact</h4>
                        <p>The poles used in pole vaulting are typically made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, or a mix of other composites.</p>

                        <li>The feeling of conquering a mental block within the sport is so rewarding.</li>
                        <li>The people that I have met because of the sport is extremely special to me.</li>
                        <li>Because the sport has given me so many awesome opportunities, it would crazy to not finish out my last seasons and I would regret it.</li>

                        <li>Lets change the font up for the website, how can I make it fun, and then for headings how can I add a text effect to them and change the color of them?</li>
                        <li>How can I hide the sections that I have not clicked, but show the one that I have?</li>
                        <li>How do I give the sections a hover effect when the cursor is over it?</li>
